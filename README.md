# Good Songs API ðŸŽµ

A Ruby on Rails API for music reviews and recommendations. Users can create accounts, write detailed song reviews, and discover music through a community feed.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Song Reviews**: Write reviews with ratings (1-3), liked aspects, and detailed text
- **Band Management**: Automatic band creation and organization
- **Review Feed**: Discover new music through community reviews
- **User Profiles**: Public user profiles showing all reviews
- **Multi-select Aspects**: Tag reviews with what you loved (Guitar, Vocals, Lyrics, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby on Rails** 8.0.2 (API mode)
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **JWT** (authentication)
- **BCrypt** (password encryption)
- **Rack-CORS** (cross-origin requests)

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.x or higher
- PostgreSQL (we recommend [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for macOS)
- Bundler gem

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd goodsongs_api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Database Setup

#### Configure PostgreSQL

Make sure PostgreSQL is running. If using Postgres.app, note the port (usually 5445).

#### Update Database Configuration

Edit `config/database.yml` if needed to match your PostgreSQL setup:

```yaml
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  database: goodsongs_api_development
  host: localhost
  port: 5445 # Update if your PostgreSQL runs on a different port
```

#### Create and Setup Database

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
rails server
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## CORS Configuration

The API is configured to accept requests from:

- `http://localhost:3000` (Rails default)
- `http://localhost:3001` (Common frontend port)

To add more origins, edit `config/initializers/cors.rb`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (not tracked in git) for sensitive configuration:

```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/goodsongs_api_development
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Ensure all tests pass (`bundle exec rspec`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request

## Common Issues

### PostgreSQL Connection Issues

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check the port in `database.yml` matches your PostgreSQL instance
- For Postgres.app users, the default port is usually 5445

### CORS Issues

- Make sure your frontend origin is listed in `config/initializers/cors.rb`
- Check browser console for specific CORS error messages

### Authentication Issues

- Ensure JWT token is included in Authorization header: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
- Check token expiration and refresh as needed
